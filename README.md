Tourism in Sri Lanka has been growing rapidly during the past few years. This is mainly because of the
beautiful sites and attractions Sri Lanka has to offer but tourist face a number of issues when they visit.
The issue we’re focusing on is that tourist are being treated unfairly when it comes to paying for various
products and services. Most of the time they are charged very high prices compared to the amount
charged from the locals. Our goal is to find a solution so that vendors and services providers cannot
charge various prices from tourist because they don’t understand our language and also because they
are unaware of the correct prices of goods and services.
Our solution consists of a website provide by the government of Sri Lanka which can accessed by various
tourist planning to visit the country. The first step is for the tourist to book their most preferred hotel
from the website. Once they have booked a hotel a unique User ID for the tourist is generated. Then the
website provides the ability to check various services such as super markets, spas, transport, book tour
guides, liquor stores, clothes shops, medical facilities, restaurants, gift shops etc. Once the tourist visits
the country and arrives at the hotel he/she booked they are provided a coupon and only then can they
order goods and services because there is no use letting them purchase anything if there in another
country because once an order is made the depending on what the product or service is, it is delivered
right to the tourist hotel room. For instance, a tourist purchases some grocery items using the website
from a selected supermarket and the groceries are delivered right to the hotel room door step. This
process is done with the use of the coupon which is given to tourist when they arrive at the hotel. The
coupon consists of a few details such as the User ID, name of the foreigner, the hotel and room number.
When the user makes an order through the website these details are delivered to the store or vendor
from which the product or service was ordered from so that it can delivered to the tourist. The payment
is made by the hotel until the tourist leaves the hotel and then the total bill with all the products and
services purchased with the hotel expenses are given so that it can be paid by the tourist at the end.
All these vendors and service providers must also be registered to this service so that tourist can
purchase from them. Therefore, there is no way of them charging tourist various undesirable prices
because the government has given each product and service a fixed price.


Our solution provides the tourist with several benefits.
 One benefit is that the tourist does not have to waste time to travel to the store.
 No hassle in having a lot of money or using credit cards always as all the payments are made by
the hotel as long as the tourist stays in the hotel. The tourist only has to pay once and that is
when he/she finally leaves the hotel.
 Every tourist is charged with the same price fairly.
 You can directly purchase the goods by yourself.
 No trouble of changing currency because the goods and services can be purchased with the
tourist respective country’s currency.
